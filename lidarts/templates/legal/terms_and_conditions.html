                <h3 class="mt-3">Welcome to Lidarts!</h3>
                <p>This page explains our terms and conditions. When you use Lidarts, you’re agreeing to all the rules on this page.
                    Some of them need to be expressed in legal language, but we’ve done our best to offer you clear and
                    simple explanations of what everything means.</p>

                <p>By using this website (the “Site”) and services (together with the Site, the “Services”) offered by
                    Lidarts.org (together with our subsidiaries, affiliates, representatives, and directors –
                    collectively “Lidarts”, “we”, or “us”) you’re agreeing to these legally binding rules (the “Terms”).
                    You’re also agreeing to our <a href="{{ url_for('legal.privacy') }}">Privacy Policy</a>, and agreeing
                    to follow any other rules on the Site, like our Community Guidelines (included below).</p>

                <p>We may change these terms from time to time. If we do, we’ll let you know about any significant or
                    material changes, by notifying you on the Site. New versions of the terms will never apply retroactively
                    – we’ll tell you the exact date they go into effect. If you continue using Lidarts after a change,
                    that means you accept the new terms.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Introduction</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Lidarts strives to become a full-fledged online darts scoring website to help our users play and train
                    darts in an enjoyable, interactive way.</p>
                <p>As an open-source project with no monetary income, we rely on work by volunteers to keep the service up
                    and improve it further. We always have a friendly ear for feedback and suggestions to improve your
                    experience on our site, so don't hesitate to <a href="{{ url_for('generic.contact') }}">contact us.</a>
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">About Creating an Account</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>To sign up for a Lidarts account, you need to be 16 or over. If you’re under 16, you can only use
                    Lidarts only with parental-guardian supervision and consent. You’re responsible for your account
                    and all the activity on it.</p>

                <p>You can browse Lidarts without registering for an account. But to use some of Lidarts’s functions,
                    you’ll need to register, choose a username, and set a password. When you do that, the information
                    you give us has to be accurate and complete. Don’t impersonate anyone else or choose names that are
                    offensive or that violate anyone’s rights. If you don’t follow these rules, we may cancel your account.</p>

                <p>When these terms discuss “Users” or a “User”, we’ll be referring to both registered and unregistered users,
                    unless it relates to features, information or data an unregistered User does not or cannot have access to.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">License and Usage</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Lidarts is a free/libre open-source software project licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License. More information on this
                    can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/mischkadb/lidarts/blob/master/LICENSE">License file</a>.
                    Registered Users can use all of Lidarts' features for their own personal purposes. Lidarts reserves the right
                    to decide what kind of use of the Services is appriopriate.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Account termination</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>You can delete your account at any time. This will permanently erase your account and all data associated
                    with it. However we may retain certain information as required by law or for our legitimate business purposes.
                    Account termination can only be requested by <a href="mailto:contact@lidarts.org">contacting us</a> at the moment.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Community Guidelines</h3>
                <hr>
                Users have to use Lidarts' Services with the best intentions to ensure the best possible experience for everyone.
                Lidarts has the ultimate say to decide what behaviour is appropiate and reserves the right to ban or close User accounts
                without warning or the obligation to provide evidence that these guidelines have been breached.
                <p>The following list provides examples of what Users should certainly not do:</p>
                <p><strong>Cheating.</strong> Every online darts scoring service relies on trust. Games on Lidarts against other human beings
                    require every User to play honestly. Cheating includes entering wrong scores on purpose or not playing by the official rules.</p>
                <p><strong>Staging games and their results.</strong> Although not yet in use, Lidarts might measure the Users' playing strength
                    to improve the experience of the Services. Intentionally trading wins or losses to obfuscate your playing strength manipulates
                    this system.</p>
                <p><strong>Bad sportsmanship.</strong> Be respectful to other players. Do not harass, insult, spam or waste someone's time on purpose.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Impersonation.</strong> Registered Users may choose a publicly displayed username. Don't impersonate others, we
                    recommend you to use a recognizable pseudonym.</p>
                <p><strong>Publishing copyrighted material.</strong> Registered users can share their own content publicly and are responsible
                for everything related to these actions. It is illegal to share content you didn't create by yourself or you don't have the
                permission or right to share for.</p>
                <p><strong>Abuse Lidarts' infrastructure.</strong> Running the Services costs money, so we need to scale with care.
                    By putting unreasonable loads on our servers you might impair other Users' experience on our site. We reserve the right
                to determine what is reasonable.</p>
                <p><strong>Breaking into accounts or our servers.</strong> To protect us and our Users, we will report any illegal activity
                to authorities. You can help improving our security by <a href="{{ url_for('generic.contact') }}">reporting security issues</a>
                that you encounter to us.</p>

                <p>This list is non-exhaustive and just provides a few examples that we consider important for a peaceful community. We
                reserve the rights to decide what violates our guidelines and decide about appropriate penalization.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Privacy</h3>
